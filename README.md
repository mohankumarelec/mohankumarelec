Visit [mohanram.dev](https://mohanram.dev) - My portfolio site where Windows XP lives on! 🖥️✨

Being a 90s kid, I built this nostalgic playground complete with:
- 🎯 Classic Pinball & Minesweeper (because who doesn't miss those?)
- 🌐 Time-travel Internet Explorer - type ANY website to see how it looked in the 2000s!
- 🎵 That iconic Windows XP startup sound (still hits different!)
- 📁 A "Nostalgia" folder packed with gems like GTA Vice City trailers

*Sometimes you just need to escape the complexity of modern tech and chill with some good old XP vibes!*
